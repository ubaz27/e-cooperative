                            <h3>Who we are:</h3>
                           <p>NASCS NICS is a Cooperative Society for the staff of National Assembly Service Commission, approved by the Commission to operate a non-interest (Islamic) model of finance.

                           <h3>Benefit</h3>
                           <p>The objective of the Cooperative Society is to promote the economic interest of its members by providing them with investment avenues, through ethical, non-interest finance investment schemes It is also intended to provide them with avenues for financing their material needs (through the use of various products such as cost-plus profit sale (murabaha), forward sale (salam), lease (ijara), joint venture partnership (musharaka) etc.), based on mark up, rental, profit share, etc as the case may be.
                            Also, members would share in the profit made by the Society in the form of dividend based on the number of their shares outstanding at the end of each financial year (though dividend would only be paid to total shares outstanding in the books of the Society 6 months before the end of each financial year). This is in addition to profits realized from the investment of membersâ€™ funds outstanding in their investment account at the end of each financial year.
