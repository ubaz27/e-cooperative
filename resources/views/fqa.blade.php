                            <li><h5>What happens to my savings, investment, and any outstanding obligation upon termination of my membership by death?</h5></li>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a.	During the phase of registration, every member shall nominate a person to whom his/her shares or savings shall be transferred to in the event of death or permanent incapacitation. The member may, at any point, change this nominee.</li>

                            <li><h5>How can a member make Monthly Contributions?</h5></li>
                            <p>Monthly Contributions can be made through direct deduction Finance and Accoounts Department, or a standing order transfer from a members’ NASC to the Society’s account (in the case of retirees).</p>

                            <li><h5>What is non-interest finance?</h5></li>
                            <p>It is a method of financing that is based on ethical principles of fairness and justice. Islamic finance is a type of non-interest finance and it prohibits the collection or payment of interest. It also prohibits engaging in activities that are deemed harmful to the society, for example tobacco, alcohol, pork, gambling, pornography, etc. If something is immoral, one cannot profit from it. On the other hand, it allows profit sharing and loss sharing among the counterparties in a trade or financing transaction according to mutually agreed ratios.</p>

                            <li><h5>What are the advantages that could be derived from using non-interest/Islamic financing?</h5></li>
                            <p>a.	Transactions are related to real economic activities not speculation. Amounts invested in a non-interest finance transaction are applied to activities like construction of buildings, investing in small businesses, financing farmers to grow crops, consumer products finance, equipment leasing (ijarah, different from conventional leasing), etc.</p>
                            <p>b.	Risk sharing scheme. Profit can only be earned on assets where ownership risk is taken. Under this scheme, profit cannot be earned without taking risk – there are no “free riders”.</p>
                            <p>c.	Transparency and fairness. Counter parties involved must have complete clarity on the terms of the product. There is no room for uncertainty, in order to avoid any form of conflict.</p>
                            <p>d.	Prohibition of interest (riba). Interest is exploitative and unjust and could lead to the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
                            <p>The prohibition of dealings in interest excludes a lot of staff from participating in conventional finance schemes and limits their opportunities for savings and investments. Therefore, non-interest finance provides such people with alternative investment avenues, in addition to the resources available for further investment in the real sector of the economy.</p>


                            <li><h5>How is non-interest finance different from conventional finance?</h5></li>
                            <p>a.	Time value of money is the basis for charging interest on capital, while profit on trade of goods or rent, charged for asset use is the basis for earning return.</p>
                            <p>b.	Interest is charged even where the borrower is not making any profit. Therefore, it is not based on a profit and loss sharing model. In non-interest finance profits are shared by all parties. No profit, no return for the financier.</p>
                            <p>c.	Using conventional financing methods for purchase of assets (e.g. car, home financing), the NASC lends you money on interest and you purchase the asset. However, in non- interest finance the financier (in this case the Society) must first take ownership of the asset and then either rent the asset or sell it on to the customer (on a cost-plus basis with deferred payment).</p>



                            <li><h5>What savings options are available for members of the NASCS NICS?</h5></li>
                            <p>i.	<b>Regular Savings:</b>  This is based on the principles of Qard (benevolent loan). It would have the following features:

                                <p>b.	A maximum of 50% could be withdrawn after given 1-month notice. Special withdrawal (immediate withdrawal) could be approved on need basis. Withdrawal is only allowed once in a year and provided the member does not have any outstanding loan.</p>
                                <p>c.	It would entitle its holder to a Qard Hassan loan equivalent to 200% of the amount outstanding in the account as at the time of applying for the loan, subject to the availability of funds and the approval of the MC.</p>
                                <p>d.	Savings account could only be a maximum of 50% of the total contribution by a member (the remaining 50% or more must be investment).</p>
                                
                            </p>

                            <p>ii.	<b>Target Savings:</b>    This is a special deposit outside members’ regular contribution, which could be based on the contract of:
                            <p>a.

                            <p>Target savings could take either one of the following forms:</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>a.	Project Savings</b>

                                <b>b.	Term Deposit</b>
                                <p>Members could be saving either a fixed or variable amount on a regular basis (at least monthly) with the intention of saving a certain amount at the end of a given period of time (not less than a year).

                                </p>
                            </p>

                            <p><h4>Features of the Accounts</h4></p>
                            <p>•	For the mudarabah type of target savings, profit generated is to be shared in the ratio of 50:50 between the cooperators and the NASCS NICS while loss if any is to be borne by the cooperators except in proven cases of negligence and breach of contract, in which case NASCS NICS would have to bear the loss.</p>
                            <p>Members could not withdraw any amount from the account until the target amount or time specified at the beginning of the contract is reached, except on special cases provided a reasonable notice is given. For the mudarabah type of target savings, withdrawal before reaching the target amount or target date would make the member forfeit any share of profit due to him/her.</p>
                            
                            </p>

                            <p>iii.	<b>Investment Account:</b> This would be on the basis of Mudarabah and would have the following features:</p>
